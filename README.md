# Vibration-Data-Analysis-of-a-Centrifugal-Pump
I did this project which IIT Roorkee MIED PHD team where we work to build a Digital twin of a centrifugal pump using AI-ML
Here in this case we are dealing with the real time data that come from sensor that we install at pump body
we are trying here around 2 model and try to get insight and comparision from all two.
we are trying to plot Diffrent plots that makes this model beautiful to interpreate and get insights
